# Web-App-2

## Introduction
A team project (5 members), in which we designed and developed website for a health clinic. Each group member had different features to work and implement.

## Jalal's contribution.
I worked on the doctor, doctor's review and list of services pages.
- [x] For the doctor's page, a user to the website could see the details of all the doctors serving at the clinic, and the reviews associated with each of the doctor. A logged in admin could perform CRUD/ CMS on the doctor's profile. 
- [x] A visitor to the clinic website could submit reviews
